## What are For Loops in Java?\n\nFor loops in Java are used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times. They are particularly useful when the number of iterations is known beforehand. The syntax and functionality of for loops are detailed below.\n\n### Syntax and Structure\n\nThe basic syntax of a for loop in Java is as follows:\n\n```java\nfor (initialExpression; testExpression; updateExpression) {\n    // body of the loop\n}\n```\n\n- **initialExpression**: This part initializes and/or declares variables and executes only once at the beginning of the loop.\n- **testExpression**: This condition is evaluated before each iteration. If the condition is true, the loop body is executed.\n- **updateExpression**: This part updates the value of the initial expression after each iteration [SOURCE 1].\n\n### Flow of Execution\n\n1. **Initialization**: The `initialExpression` is executed once at the beginning.\n2. **Condition Check**: The `testExpression` is evaluated. If it is true, the loop body is executed.\n3. **Execution**: The body of the loop is executed.\n4. **Update**: The `updateExpression` is executed.\n5. **Repeat**: Steps 2-4 are repeated until the `testExpression` evaluates to false [SOURCE 1].\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Example 1: Displaying a Text Multiple Times\n\n```java\nclass Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int n = 5;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {\n            System.out.println(\"Java is fun\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nJava is fun\nJava is fun\nJava is fun\nJava is fun\nJava is fun\n```\n\nIn this example, the loop runs 5 times, printing \"Java is fun\" each time [SOURCE 1].\n\n#### Example 2: Displaying Numbers from 1 to 5\n\n```java\nclass Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int n = 5;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {\n            System.out.println(i);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n```\n\nThis loop prints numbers from 1 to 5 [SOURCE 1].\n\n#### Example 3: Sum of Natural Numbers\n\n```java\nclass Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int sum = 0;\n        int n = 1000;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {\n            sum += i;\n        }\n        System.out.println(\"Sum = \" + sum);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nSum = 500500\n```\n\nThis loop calculates the sum of natural numbers from 1 to 1000 [SOURCE 1].\n\n### For-Each Loop\n\nThe for-each loop is an alternative syntax for iterating through arrays and collections. It simplifies the process of looping through elements.\n\n```java\nclass Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int[] numbers = {3, 7, 5, -5};\n        for (int number : numbers) {\n            System.out.println(number);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n3\n7\n5\n-5\n```\n\nThis loop iterates through each element in the `numbers` array and prints it [SOURCE 1].\n\n### Infinite For Loop\n\nAn infinite for loop occurs when the `testExpression` never evaluates to false. This can be used to create loops that run indefinitely.\n\n```java\nclass Infinite {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; --i) {\n            System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the loop will run indefinitely, printing \"Hello\" repeatedly until the program is terminated [SOURCE 1].\n\n### Looping Through Arrays\n\nFor loops can also be used to iterate through arrays. The `length` property of the array can be used to determine the number of iterations.\n\n```java\nString[] cars = {\"Volvo\", \"BMW\", \"Ford\", \"Mazda\"};\nfor (int i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {\n    System.out.println(cars[i]);\n}\n```\n\nThis loop prints each element in the `cars` array [SOURCE 2].\n\n### For-Each Loop for Arrays\n\nThe for-each loop provides a more readable and concise way to iterate through arrays.\n\n```java\nString[] cars = {\"Volvo\", \"BMW\", \"Ford\", \"Mazda\"};\nfor (String car : cars) {\n    System.out.println(car);\n}\n```\n\nThis loop also prints each element in the `cars` array, but in a more straightforward manner [SOURCE 2].\n\n## Sources\n\n1.
